# RETOI - Route Elevation to Intensity

## Description
This is a couple of programs designed to convert a GPX file with elevation data to data which an arduino can utilize to adjust the intensity of a bike.

## Depends
The arduino portion depends on the awesome Circular Buffer library found here https://github.com/rlogiacco/CircularBuffer. It is assumed you have it installed before use of the code.
